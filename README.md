## Overview

TortoiseTTS Audio to Cloning is a project that explores the synergy between text-to-speech (TTS) technology and voice cloning. This repository contains the necessary code and resources for training, utilizing, and experimenting with a TTS model named TortoiseTTS. The project also investigates the potential of using TortoiseTTS for voice cloning purposes, leveraging existing audio data.

## Features

- Train and fine-tune the TortoiseTTS model with your own data.
- Generate synthetic speech from text using the trained TortoiseTTS model.
- Experiment with voice cloning by combining TTS capabilities and audio data.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TortoiseTTS_AudioToCloning.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd TortoiseTTS_AudioToCloning`
3. Set up your virtual environment: `virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### Training TortoiseTTS

To train the TortoiseTTS model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your training data in the required format.
2. Run the training script: `python train.py --data_dir /path/to/training/data`

### Generating Speech

Generate speech using the trained model:

1. Run the generation script: `python generate.py --text "Hello, how are you?"`

## Voice Cloning

The project provides tools to explore voice cloning:

1. Collect and preprocess audio data of the target speaker.
2. Adapt the trained TortoiseTTS model using the collected audio data.
3. Generate speech using the adapted model to replicate the target speaker's voice.
